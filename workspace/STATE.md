# STATE

Phase: 1 (Research and positioning) - loop 1 complete (setup)
Loop: 1
Date: 2026-10-21

## Open question for the builder (answer when convenient; defaults are in use)
Do you accept the default stack in DECISIONS.md D-002/D-003 (Python 3.12 + FastAPI + Postgres, AWS, Terraform written but never applied)? If you prefer another language/framework or cloud, say so and I will supersede the decision before Phase 3 step 1.

## Done
- Workspace scaffold: STATE, BACKLOG, DECISIONS, ASSUMPTIONS, SOURCES, docs/, diagrams/, app/.
- Existing foundation (stdlib Python: reconcile, versioned checklist, tenancy/idempotency store, synthetic fixtures, 12 tests + 6 fixture cases) moved to app/; verify still passes.
- Domain decided: commercial lending (SME and SBA). Supersedes the open item in docs/decisions/0002.

## Next (loop 2)
B-101: Regulatory and process map for SBA 7(a)/504 from SOP 50 10 (primary sources first).

## Blockers
None. No paid resources, no outside contact, no real data.

## Hard constraints (re-checked each loop)
Human underwriter makes every final credit decision. Synthetic data only. Nothing outside ./workspace/ and this repo. No unverified claims.
